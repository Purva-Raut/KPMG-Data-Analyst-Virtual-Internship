# KPMG-Data-Analyst-Virtual-Internship

The project was divided into the 3 tasks.

Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
Task 1 involved conducting a data quality assessment, becoming familiar with the datasets, reviewing data quality, and cleaning the data to prepare it for further analysis. To address data quality issues, I drafted an email to the client outlining potential strategies.

Task 2: Data Insights
Task 2 required analysing three datasets containing information on existing customers and recommending target customers among 1,000 new customers without transaction histories. I created a presentation outlining the project objectives, data exploration, model development, and interpretation.

Task 3 involved developing data insights and presenting them visually using Tableau. Specifically, I created visualizations in Tableau that illustrate the features used to target customers and a list of targeted customers. The Tableau visualization can be accessed here:

Overall, the project involved conducting a thorough data analysis, including a data quality assessment, data insights, and data visualization using Tableau. Through these tasks, valuable insights were gained into customer behavior and preferences, which can help inform future business strategies.
